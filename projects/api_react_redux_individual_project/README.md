Personal React/Redux Site
Web Applications, HTTP/API, Level 2, Project
You are going to design and build your very own React/Redux site with a theme and content of your choosing.

This site will be a portfolio piece.

Requirements:

Your site must integrate with an online API. Here is a huge list of open APIs you can use. Some fun ones include: 
Open Movie Database API
Rotten Tomatoes API
Weather Forecast API
Edmunds Vehicle API
Mashape API Library
Programmable Web API Library
Your site must have at least 3 views (pages) using React Router.
Your site must be responsive. Can use any method to accomplish this you want.
One of the big challenges in accessing APIs is getting around the browser's "Same Origin Policy". Many of the APIs above require you to make requests from a server instead of the client. V School has built a small, simple request forwarder to help make this process easier. It may not work in all cases, and should only be used if you know your API of choice doesn't allow frontend requests.

Check out the documentation for the request forwarder here.

Have fun!
